			<title>CNET News.com: USB 2 arrives in Linux test version</title>
			
			<description>
				"The USB support in the world of Linux is much more freewheeling than at
				Microsoft. The Linux USB software has been created by a largely
				self-appointed team of programmers, who feed batches of code to the
				main kernel project."

				"If there's one thing free software developers hate more than writing
				documentation, it's fighting a long-drawn out and unglamorous legal
				battle. But the latest episode in the UCITA saga bodes ill for any
				free software author based in the United States."

			<title>Mandrake Linux Security Update Advisory: sudo</title>
			
			<description>
				"The SuSE Security Team discovered a vulnerability in sudo that can be
				exploited to obtain root privilege because sudo is installed setuid
				root. An attacker could trick sudo to log failed sudo calls
				executing the sendmail (or equivalent mailer) program with root
				privileges and an environment that is not completely clean."

				"'For me, what Darwin brings is not so much another alternative to Linux
				or FreeBSD or whatever, as those systems I have that are running
				some Open Source BSD are likely to continue doing that. It's the
				fact that there is an Open Source kernel and utility suite and
				libraries that will support proprietary commercial applications that
				I'm willing to pay for but can't run on most of my other systems.'"

				"It seems that several people decided I should show off their web photo
				album generation tool of choice. So, in response to your
				suggestions, I'm going to put off the cool network tool for today;
				let's go on the premise that you all took thousands of pictures over
				the holidays and are dying to make them available on the Web."

			<title>Conectiva Linux Security Announcement: sudo</title>
			
			<description>
				"Sebastian Krahmer from SuSe found a vulnerability in the sudo package which
				could be used by a local attacker to obtain root privileges.
				Versions prior to and including 1.6.3p7 remove a few potentially
				dangerous environment variables prior to executing a command as
				root, but other variables could be abused and used to obtain root
				privileges."

			<title>IBM developerWorks: Introducing XFS</title>
			
			<description>
				"Up until now, choosing the appropriate next-generation Linux
				filesystem has been refreshingly straightforward. Those who were
				looking for raw performance generally leaned towards ReiserFS, while
				those more interested in meticulous data integrity features
				preferred ext3. However, with the release of XFS for Linux, things
				have suddenly become much more confusing. In particular, it's no
				longer clear that ReiserFS is still the next-gen performance
				leader."

			<title>Red Hat Security Advisory: sudo</title>
			
			<description>
				"Versions of sudo prior to 1.6.4 would not clear the environment before
				sending an email notification about unauthorized sudo attempts,
				making it possible for an attacker to supply parameters to the mail
				program. In the worst case, this could lead to a local root
				exploit."
